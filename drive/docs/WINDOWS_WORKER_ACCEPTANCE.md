# Windows Worker / GDrive Acceptance Runbook

This runbook is the remaining deployment gate for private PR #1. It proves the
runtime on real hosts; it does not change the application architecture.

## Security boundary

- Bind the worker-control service only to the Optiplex Tailscale interface or a
  firewall-restricted private interface.
- Generate a fresh high-entropy token outside Git and expose it through
  `YZU_WORKER_CONTROL_TOKEN` on the controller and worker.
- Never commit the token, `.env` files, Tailscale auth keys, SSH keys, rclone
  configuration, or worker inventory secrets.
- The control plane rejects missing/incorrect tokens and fences every write by
  `worker_id + attempt`.

## 1. Controller

From the private checkout on the Optiplex:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD:$PWD/kernel:$PWD/drive"
export YZU_WORKER_CONTROL_TOKEN="<fresh-secret>"
python -m scripts.yzu_cluster.worker_control \
  --repo-root "$PWD/drive" \
  --host "<optiplex-tailscale-ip>" \
  --port 8780
```

Health is intentionally non-sensitive:

```bash
curl http://<optiplex-tailscale-ip>:8780/health
```

Expected:

```json
{"status":"ok","token_required":true}
```

## 2. Windows worker

The Windows checkout must contain:

- `scripts/cluster_agent/remote_collect.py`
- `scripts/yzu_cluster/remote_worker.py`
- the Python packages needed by the remote collector
- outbound HTTPS access to the public source
- Tailscale access to the controller port

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "$PWD;$PWD\kernel;$PWD\drive"
$env:YZU_WORKER_CONTROL_TOKEN = "<same-fresh-secret>"
py -m scripts.yzu_cluster.remote_worker `
  --controller "http://<optiplex-tailscale-ip>:8780" `
  --repo-root "C:\cw\Sharpe-Renaissance\drive" `
  --worker-id "windows-01" `
  --pool "windows_lab" `
  --capabilities "http,python" `
  --lease-seconds 120 `
  --heartbeat-seconds 30
```

The worker deliberately supports only `http_manifest` in this acceptance lane.
Unsupported jobs are failed explicitly rather than executed through arbitrary
shell input.

## 3. Submit one safe public-source collection

Use the existing Research Drive job submission path to create an auto-approved
`http_manifest` job with:

- a stable idempotency key;
- one or more direct public HTTPS items;
- a declared dataset ID;
- validation requiring at least one non-empty file;
- declared `http` capability;
- no credentials or private source data.

The job must be visible as queued before the Windows worker claims it.

## 4. Required success evidence

Capture the following identifiers and payloads:

1. Worker join response:
   - worker ID;
   - pool;
   - capabilities;
   - measured CPU, free memory, and free disk;
   - fresh heartbeat.
2. Claim response:
   - job ID;
   - run ID;
   - attempt;
   - lease expiry;
   - declared outputs.
3. Runtime heartbeat while the download is active.
4. Attempt-fenced artifact upload response:
   - artifact path;
   - bytes;
   - SHA-256;
   - worker ID and attempt.
5. Controller materialisation:
   - dataset ID;
   - output manifest ID/path;
   - validation result;
   - file checksums.
6. GDrive proof:
   - `rclone copy` success;
   - `rclone check --one-way` success;
   - canonical remote path.
7. Registry proof:
   - promoted dataset ID matches the manifest output ID;
   - canonical remote matches the verified archive;
   - registry read-back succeeds.
8. Final state:
   - runtime lifecycle is `registered` or `query_ready`;
   - legacy job remains `completed` as a compatibility projection;
   - Library, Resources, and Synthesis expose the same run/output identity.

A completed process without manifest, verified archive, promotion, and registry
read-back is not an accepted result.

## 5. Required failure/retry evidence

Run a second harmless job and stop the Windows worker after it enters `running`.
Do not send a terminal result.

Verify:

1. Heartbeats stop.
2. The lease expires.
3. Runtime moves to `retrying` while legacy state reconciles back to `queued`.
4. A new claim receives `attempt + 1`.
5. A late heartbeat, usage report, artifact upload, completion, or failure from
   the old attempt is rejected.
6. No duplicate Library registration or lifecycle event is created.

## 6. Stop conditions

Stop and preserve logs if any of these occur:

- private code or credentials would need to be pushed to a public remote;
- worker control is reachable outside the intended private interface;
- a stale attempt is accepted;
- canonical registry mutation occurs before manifest/archive proof;
- GDrive verification fails but Library still exposes the asset;
- legacy and runtime states cannot be reconciled without destructive migration.

## 7. Acceptance report

Return:

- controller and worker commit SHA;
- worker-control URL with host redacted where appropriate;
- exact commands used, excluding secrets;
- job/run/attempt/output/manifest/registry IDs;
- relevant JSON responses and logs;
- GDrive verification evidence;
- retry/fencing evidence;
- final Resources, Synthesis, and Library state;
- any remaining deployment-specific blocker.
